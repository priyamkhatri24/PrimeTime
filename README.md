# PrimeTimer

The Project is live at: <a href="https://primetimer.netlify.app/">primetimer.netlify.app</a>

This is a Javascript Stopwatch and Countdown timer. I have implemented the logic of the timer using JS Promises and setTimeout Function. I have made this project to practice what is called "Functional Programming".
